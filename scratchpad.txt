TOOO:
-------------
- TODO: Pool loudness KMeans with Binary RBM

- TODO: update search script so that query lengths can be specified from the command line

- TODO: Try BarkBands with narrower range in Hz, maybe 50hz - 12khz

- BUG: It's possible to add duplicates to the database because of external_id
	truncation

- BUG: Tests are being run multiple times when imported by other tests

- BUG: Features with a step size > 1 get zeroed at buffer boundaries by PyTablesFramesController

- Profile ingest.py. How can this be faster?

- Reread (and understand) 'Encoding Sound Timbre in the Auditory System'

- Reread (and understand) 'Multiscale scattering for audio classification'

- Bug: It's possible to load controllers of the wrong type with 
	PickledController-derived classes
	
- Automatic rebuilding of search indices after data is added

- Non-square Gabor filters

- Something about the PyTables lock gets screwed up when writing large amounts
  of data
  
- Add mel scale and refactor some code in analyze.bark

- BUG : Address equivalence bug: [1,4,10] and [1,6,10] are considered equivalent.  This
  is incorrect

- Write LearnedFeature tests

- Patterns

- Sphinx documentation

- multi-process sync - Deferred until I can figure out celery chord bug

- Add celery to list of dependencies once I've settled on using it

- mp3 -> wav conversion by acquirers

- Configurable encoder and decoder for the "audio" feature, making it possible
	to store mp3, ogg vorbis, or some other audio-encoding, instead of just
	raw audio.  It'd be great if I could store lots of useful features AND
	compress the data
