Observation - Sequences are sometimes considered similar because of background
noise, as opposed to the events in the sequence that a human would consider
salient.

There are 3 types of similarity
- substitution
- timbre
- association or co-occurence

TOOO:
-------------
BUG: Compute FFT, loudness and centroid. Remove loudness and run display.py.
	The sync fails because there's a Precomputed FFT extractor in the chain,
	but FFT data isn't stored.
	
Look at Rbm reconstructions

Fix Pipeline.train tests

Get rid of batch fetcher and tests

Write LearnedFeature tests

Learn Autoencoder on BarkBands and store

Multidimensional Frames indexes

arbitrary-length sound search implementation

Patterns

Sphinx documentation

multi-process sync - Deferred until I can figure out celery chord bug

Add celery to list of dependencies once I've settled on using it

Smarc audio-rate conversion by acquirers
mp3 -> wav conversion by acquirers

Configurable encoder and decoder for the "audio" feature, making it possible
	to store mp3, ogg vorbis, or some other audio-encoding, instead of just
	raw audio.  It'd be great if I could store lots of useful features AND
	compress the data


 

speed and storage size tests for
	- mongodb
	- PyTables
	- Cassandra
	- SqlLite
Doing the following
	- writes
	- random reads
	- range reads
	- binary feature similarity
	- minhash similarity
