Observation - Sequences are sometimes considered similar because of background
noise, as opposed to the events in the sequence that a human would consider
salient.

There are 3 types of similarity
- substitution
- timbre
- association or co-occurence

TOOO:
-------------
Fetch abstract base class and fetch-from-db implementation

Learner abstract base class

autoencoder and rbm classes implement Learner interface

Write Pipeline and tests

Multidimensional Frames indexes

arbitrary-length sound search implementation

Sphinx documentation

multi-process sync - Deferred until I can figure out celery chord bug

Add celery to list of dependencies once I've settled on using it

Smarc audio-rate conversion by acquirers
mp3 -> wav conversion by acquirers

Configurable encoder and decoder for the "audio" feature, making it possible
	to store mp3, ogg vorbis, or some other audio-encoding, instead of just
	raw audio.  It'd be great if I could store lots of useful features AND
	compress the data


 

speed and storage size tests for
	- mongodb
	- PyTables
	- Cassandra
	- SqlLite
Doing the following
	- writes
	- random reads
	- range reads
	- binary feature similarity
	- minhash similarity
