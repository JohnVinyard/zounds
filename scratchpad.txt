Observation - Sequences are sometimes considered similar because of background
noise, as opposed to the events in the sequence that a human would consider
salient.

There are 3 types of similarity
- substitution
- timbre
- association or co-occurence

PyTables write lock is being mishandled (we always go to max_buffer_size)
Fix failing tests

Write Pipeline
 

speed and storage size tests for
	- mongodb
	- PyTables
	- Cassandra
	- SqlLite
Doing the following
	- writes
	- random reads
	- range reads
	- binary feature similarity
	- minhash similarity
