TOOO:
-------------
1)implement util.safenorm, which can handle one or more vectors
2)implement util.safelog, which avoid divide by zero errors
3) rename FrameController.iter_id to something more appropriate
4) Why is Exhaustive search so much slower now

- Profile ingest.py. How can this be faster?

- Reread (and understand) 'Encoding Sound Timbre in the Auditory System'

- Reread (and understand) 'Multiscale scattering for audio classification'

- Normalize searches so they all return addresses, like they're supposed to

- Add search.py to quickstart, once all searches behave as they should

- when nframes > 1, trailing edges aren't processed. Why not?

- Bug: It's possible to load controllers of the wrong type with 
	PickledController-derived classes
	
- Automatic rebuilding of search indices after data is added

- Non-square Gabor filters

- "Dead" frequencies in Bark Bands

- Something about the PyTables lock gets screwed up when writing large amounts
  of data
  
- Add mel scale and refactor some code in analyze.bark

- Address equivalence bug: [1,4,10] and [1,6,10] are considered equivalent.  This
  is incorrect

multi-process sync - Deferred until I can figure out celery chord bug

Add celery to list of dependencies once I've settled on using it

Smarc audio-rate conversion by acquirers
mp3 -> wav conversion by acquirers

Configurable encoder and decoder for the "audio" feature, making it possible
	to store mp3, ogg vorbis, or some other audio-encoding, instead of just
	raw audio.  It'd be great if I could store lots of useful features AND
	compress the data
