- Profile ingest.py. How can this be faster?
- django-esque starter app that includes config.py, display.py, ingest.py and search.py

- Bug: It's possible to load controllers of the wrong type with 
	PickledController-derived classes
- Automatic rebuilding of search indices after data is added
- Non-square Gabor filters
- "Dead" frequencies in Bark Bands

Smarc audio-rate conversion by acquirers
mp3 -> wav conversion by acquirers

Configurable encoder and decoder for the "audio" feature, making it possible
	to store mp3, ogg vorbis, or some other audio-encoding, instead of just
	raw audio.  It'd be great if I could store lots of useful features AND
	compress the data
