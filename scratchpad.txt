TOOO:
-------------
TODO: Sphinx documentation

TODO: Use the python logging module

TODO: Warning for AIM features when overlapping windows are used.
 
TODO: There are still a couple broken test references in
analyze/feature/test_composite.py

TODO: Ensure that all quickstart scripts use argparse.

TODO: README file for setuptools

- Faster, chunk-based or all-at-once processing for Extractors

Use bfcc flux to do synthesis. Create a new ordering of frames so that flux
 stays close to the same, but different frames are used.
 
Finish Constant-Q implementation 

TODO:  Try lowpass filter subtraction method for spectrogram sharpening

Allow step-sizes that aren't windowsize / 2

Allow nframes values of -1, or inf, or something, so that processing
can be done all at once.

2) - BUG: Pooled doesn't work for nested Pooled features

- TODO: Nice printing for Extractor, FrameModel, Preprocess, Learn, Environment, etc...

- TODO: Pass an id or a (source,external_id) argument to search.py as the query 

- TODO: Tile method should work with any extractor, not just a Pipeline 

- TODO: Visualize Exhaustive search results (features and distances)

- BUG: It's possible to add duplicates to the database because of external_id
	truncation
	
- TODO: Ensure that quickstart/ab.py works with a few different algorithms

- BUG: Step sizes of > 1 seem to screw up parallelized ExhaustiveSearch

-TODO: Compare results from serial and parallel ExhaustiveSearch implementations,
		ensuring they're identical

- BUG: Tests are being run multiple times when imported by other tests

- Profile ingest.py. How can this be faster?

- Reread (and understand) 'Encoding Sound Timbre in the Auditory System'

- Reread (and understand) 'Multiscale scattering for audio classification'

- Bug: It's possible to load controllers of the wrong type with 
	PickledController-derived classes
	
- FEATURE : Automatic rebuilding of search indices after data is added

- Add mel scale and refactor some code in analyze.bark

- BUG : Address equivalence bug: [1,4,10] and [1,6,10] are considered equivalent.  This
  is incorrect

- Write LearnedFeature tests

- Patterns

- multi-process sync - Deferred until I can figure out celery chord bug

- Add celery to list of dependencies once I've settled on using it

- mp3 -> wav conversion by acquirers

- Configurable encoder and decoder for the "audio" feature, making it possible
	to store mp3, ogg vorbis, or some other audio-encoding, instead of just
	raw audio.  It'd be great if I could store lots of useful features AND
	compress the data
