TOOO:
-------------
- Standardize "inshape"-type parameter names

- update all tests

- Faster, chunk-based or all-at-once processing for Extractors

- Add a note in the docs about the source distribution being the preferred route

- Add a small collection of soundfiles downloadable from the doc site

- If you're on Ubuntu, you can use the command `xdg-open <html-file>` to open a local file or URL using the default browser.

- Make a note in the documentation about ALSA audio

- Try writing a simple, realtime JACK-based audio player (check out Alex McLean's SmoothDirt repo)

TODO: Answer the question "How do file system seek times compare to PyTables?"

TODO: Get rid of runtime warning in safe_unit_norm

- BUG: It's possible to add duplicates to the database because of external_id
	truncation

TODO: Two modes for ExhaustiveSearch

TODO: Do another installation test run and move up a new dist package

TODO: extractors using multiprocessing hang when updating database

TODO: Sphinx documentation

TODO: Use the python logging module

TODO: Warning for AIM features when overlapping windows are used.
 
TODO: There are still a couple broken test references in
analyze/feature/test_composite.py

TODO: Ensure that all quickstart scripts use argparse.

TODO: README file for setuptools

Use bfcc flux to do synthesis. Create a new ordering of frames so that flux
 stays close to the same, but different frames are used.
 
Finish Constant-Q implementation 

TODO:  Try lowpass filter subtraction method for spectrogram sharpening

2) - BUG: Pooled doesn't work for nested Pooled features

- TODO: Nice printing for Extractor, FrameModel, Preprocess, Learn, Environment, etc...

- TODO: Pass an id or a (source,external_id) argument to search.py as the query 

- TODO: Tile method should work with any extractor, not just a Pipeline 

- TODO: Visualize Exhaustive search results (features and distances)

- TODO: Ensure that quickstart/ab.py works with a few different algorithms

- BUG: Step sizes of > 1 seem to screw up parallelized ExhaustiveSearch

-TODO: Compare results from serial and parallel ExhaustiveSearch implementations,
		ensuring they're identical

- BUG: Tests are being run multiple times when imported by other tests

- Reread (and understand) 'Encoding Sound Timbre in the Auditory System'

- Reread (and understand) 'Multiscale scattering for audio classification'

- Bug: It's possible to load controllers of the wrong type with 
	PickledController-derived classes
	
- FEATURE : Automatic rebuilding of search indices after data is added

- Add mel scale and refactor some code in analyze.bark

- BUG : Address equivalence bug: [1,4,10] and [1,6,10] are considered equivalent.  This
  is incorrect

- Write LearnedFeature tests

- mp3 -> wav conversion by acquirers

- Configurable encoder and decoder for the "audio" feature, making it possible
	to store mp3, ogg vorbis, or some other audio-encoding, instead of just
	raw audio.  It'd be great if I could store lots of useful features AND
	compress the data
