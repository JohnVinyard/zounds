Observation - Sequences are sometimes considered similar because of background
noise, as opposed to the events in the sequence that a human would consider
salient.

There are 3 types of similarity
- substitution
- timbre
- association or co-occurence

Frames instance API

The Pipeline class and the analysis of novel, user-created patterns both require
	that it be possible to construct an extractor that takes arbitrary input. Currently
	we rebuild the extractor chain for every file/pattern that needs to be analyzed.
	This will be *very* costly if we're doing something like gathering patches 
	from disk for a machine learning task. 

FrameControllers should return all metadata and an "address" for patterns when it's done
	appending. For PyTablesFrameController, this'd be start and stop row numbers

multi-process sync - Deferred until I can figure out celery chord bug

Add celery to list of dependencies once I've settled on using it

Smarc audio-rate conversion by acquirers
mp3 -> wav conversion by acquirers

Configurable encoder and decoder for the "audio" feature, making it possible
	to store mp3, ogg vorbis, or some other audio-encoding, instead of just
	raw audio.  It'd be great if I could store lots of useful features AND
	compress the data


 

speed and storage size tests for
	- mongodb
	- PyTables
	- Cassandra
	- SqlLite
Doing the following
	- writes
	- random reads
	- range reads
	- binary feature similarity
	- minhash similarity
