# KLUDGE: This extractor works when trying to get random patches over the whole
# database, but doesn't work if we were trying to get a sliding window over, say,
# the bark bands of a single sound.  For that to work, we'd have to implement
# enqueue and dequeue methods that keep leftovers around between calls.
#
# If we're processing bark bands of a single sound all at once, we expect the
# sliding window to move over the time dimension first, and then over the frequency
# dimension.  Since each incoming chunk is of inderteminate size, we're left with
# nonsense ouput. This problem could be addressed by transposing the incoming data,
# so that the frequency dimension is traversed first, and then the time dimension.
